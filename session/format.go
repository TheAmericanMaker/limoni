// Package session records a running declarative Limoni application and replays
// the recording against the same model, verifying every frame.
//
// A recording is every message the model received, in the order Update saw
// them, plus the semantic tree each rendered frame produced. Replaying feeds
// the messages back through a fresh model and renders its View at each recorded
// frame; the first frame whose tree differs is reported as a divergence, and a
// panic in the original run is reported as reproduced or not.
//
// # Why messages rather than input
//
// A recording taken from the terminal's input would not replay: timers fire at
// different moments and asynchronous commands finish in a different order.
// Recording at Update instead captures the outcome of those races, and a
// command's effect enters the recording as the message it produced — so a
// replay never re-runs an HTTP request or reads the clock, it receives what the
// original run received. The runtime already applies command results in the
// order they were scheduled, which is what makes that stream reproducible.
//
// # What it does not guarantee
//
// Update and View must be deterministic given their inputs. A model that reads
// time.Now or math/rand directly, instead of receiving them as messages
// (engine.NowCmd), will diverge on replay. The replay detects that and names the
// frame; it cannot correct it. The limonivet analyzer in tools/limonivet flags
// such calls before they get that far.
//
// # Privacy
//
// Recordings are written with 0600 permissions and are closed by default:
//
//   - Typed text is replaced with 'x' unless Policy.RecordText is set. Special
//     keys and shortcuts are kept, because they carry the interaction.
//   - Tree values of input fields are dropped unless Policy.ExposeInputValues is
//     set, and values of sensitive nodes are always dropped.
//   - Application message types are recorded by name only unless registered
//     with Register or RegisterRedacted.
//
// Even with RecordText set, characters are redacted whenever a sensitive field
// might have focus — including in the window after a focus-moving key before
// the next frame confirms where focus went.
